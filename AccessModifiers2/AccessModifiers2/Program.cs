// class members contain fields and methods
// a variable inside a class is called FIELDS
// You can access the fields or variables by creating a object of the class
// then you can create multiple objects
// access modifiers: PUBLIC - Code is accessible for all classes
// PRIVATE - code is only accessible within the same class
// PROTECTED - Code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited
// INTERNAL - The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly
// BY default all members of a class are PRIVATE if you do not specify an access modifier
